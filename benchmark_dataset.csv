At KLA-Tencor, we're making technology advancements that are bigger—and tinier—than the world has ever seen.Who are we?  We research, develop, and manufacture the world's most advanced inspection and measurement equipment for the semiconductor and nanoelectronics industries. We enable the digital age by pushing the boundaries of technology, creating tools capable of finding defects smaller than a wavelength of visible light. We create smarter processes so that technology leaders can manufacture high-performance chips—the kind in that phone in your pocket, the tablet on your desk and nearly every electronic device you own—faster and better. We're passionate about creating solutions that drive progress and help people do what wouldn't be possible without us.  The future is calling. Will you answer?Business UnitWith over 38 years of semiconductor process control experience, chipmakers around the globe rely on KLA-Tencor to ensure that their fabs ramp next-generation devices to volume production quickly and cost-effectively.

These patterning process control solutions provide the most accurate process correctables available today; providing real-time feedback and feed-forward control to improve subsequent process steps.Why join 5D? Think of this team as a ""start-up"" company where you are offered the ultimate challenge to solve the most complex technical problems that enable the digital age.

The candidate will have the ability to work with a customer team at customer sites to conduct investigations, gather and analyze data, understand root causes of lithography patterning errors, and develop and implement lithography process control solutions to reduce patterning errors and improve yield. This engineer is expected to work with customers to publish papers at industry symposiums or in technical journals. Hands-on work with KLA-Tencor metrology systems and software will be required. Travel will be required.   Preferred QualificationsThe candidate must have a degree in Engineering, Physics, Material Science, Mathematics or related fields.  The ideal candidate will have lithography process or applications experience with intimate familiarity in overlay, focus or dose control, scanner tools, lithography or etch metrology tooling and/or lithography process development.
